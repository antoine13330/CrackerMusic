# CrackerMusic
Fan project about the 24/02/2023 Gorillaz's album : Cracker island. 
Wireframe : [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/DzisECDtdLAua38NwQWofc/CrackerMusic?node-id=0%3A1&t=lhPleUOF9514jqni-1)

## Description
This project has been created for UX/UI training in the new Gorillaz's album universe. 
As we can see in the wireframe, we wanna be able to listen the album via 3 differents music services.
Moreover, the background as to be animated with the album colors and reactiv to the played music using the [WEB AUDIO API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/api/web_audio_api).

We are not trying to make the more versatil gorillaz music player but use the album assets at their best.
Beautiful art work has been made on this album and we want to respect it. 
This is why we are not fetching the song's cover from our music providers
