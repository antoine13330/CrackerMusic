## Next Level PROJECT
This project isn't basic.
Indeed, [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/), [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) are part of the adventure.

Vite js is needed to make the website as fast as possible because threejs will take some ressources. 
Threejs is used to make the 3D Model in background that react with the music.
